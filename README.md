# project-3

I decided to do the inside of a train station because it tends to have a lot of
digital adds displayed about various subject. I thought that would be a good
way to expereiment with text animation. For each sign in my code, I tried out
different animations to learn. Though it was experimental, I did make sure to
have the animation correspond to the typopgrahy. I know the project required 
a responsive design; however, I found it was best to keep the layout landscape
to display the train, plus, I will be honest, I found it more difficult to resize
compared to doing it for a regular website (last project). There are quiet a few
interactive aspects to the site such as with many of the signs and with the
background.
